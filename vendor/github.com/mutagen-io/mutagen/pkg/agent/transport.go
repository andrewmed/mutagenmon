// Transport is the standard agent transport interface, allowing the agent
// dialing structure to invoke commands on the remote, copy files to the remote,
// and classify errors from the remote. Transport interfaces do not need to be
// safe for concurrent invocation unless being used for concurrent Dial
// operations.

	// Copy copies the specified local file (which is guaranteed to exist and be
	// a file) to the remote. The provided local path will be absolute. The
	// remote path will be a filename (i.e. without path separators) that should
	// be treated as being relative to the user's home directory.

	// Command creates (but does not start) a process that will invoke the
	// specified command on the specified remote. It should not re-direct any of
	// the output streams of the process. The command on the remote must be
	// invoked with the user's home directory as the working directory. Any
	// command provided to this interface is guaranteed to be lexable by simply
	// splitting on spaces.

	// ClassifyError is used to determine how the agent dialing infrastructure
	// should attempt to handle failure when launching agents. It is provided
	// with the process exit state as well as a string containing the standard
	// error output from the command. It should return a bool representing
	// whether or not the error condition represents a failure due to an agent
	// either not being installed or being installed improperly and a bool
	// representing whether or not the remote system should be treated as a
	// cmd.exe-like environment on Windows. If neither of these can be
	// determined reliably, this method should return an error to abort dialing.
	// If the second bool changes the dialer's platform hypothesis, it will
	// attempt to reconnect using the correct command syntax for that platform.
	// Otherwise, if the first bool indicates that the agent binary simply needs
	// to be (re-)installed, it will attempt to do so and then reconnect.
