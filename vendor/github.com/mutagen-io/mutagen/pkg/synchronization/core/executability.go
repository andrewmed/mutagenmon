		// being unmodified. It also handles cases of both-modified-same
		// behavior, and in that sense this particular check is a heuristic,

		// want the file to have the same executability setting as on the
		// preserving side (a reasonable assumption since the files were created
		// at the same time with the same contents). Fortunately, the assumption
		// behind this heuristic is irrelevant, since there is no executability
		// setting that will be propagated to and visible on the non-preserving
		// side. In that sense, the assumption here is only used to make the
		// three-way merge proceed smoothly. Finally, this check handles the
		// case where a session is being started between preserving and
		// non-preserving endpoints where both endpoints have a copy of the
		// files already (which is actually also just a special case of
		// both-modified-same behavior without an ancestor). In this case, we
		// also assume that the non-preserving side should have the same
		// executability bits as the preserving side for files at the same path
		// with the same contents, and again this assumption has no visible
		// effects - it is only to make the merging proceed smoothly.

		// file on the non-preserving side. However, this is unlikely to occur
		// in practice, and even if it does, it's a one-time operation to then
		// strip the executability bit on the preserving side. In contrast, if
