	// At this point, we know that beta is modified and contains non-deletion
	// changes (either modifications or creations). There is one special case
	// that we can handle here in an automatic and intuitive (from the user
	// perspective) manner: if alpha is nil (i.e. it has no contents due to none
	// having existed or them having been deleted) and it's not the case that
	// both the ancestor and beta are directories (i.e. at least one of them is
	// nil or a non-directory type), then we can simply nil out the ancestor and
	// leave the contents on beta as they are.
	//
	// To understand why this is the only case that we can handle, we have to
	// consider what happens as soon as one of these conditions is not met.
	//
	// If alpha were non-nil, it would mean that there was content on alpha. It
	// wouldn't say anything about whether or not the content was modified (we'd
	// have to do a diff against the ancestor to determine that), but neither
	// case can work. Even if the content is not modified, we still want to
	// repropagate it to enforce mirroring, but we're blocked from doing that by
	// the changes that exist on beta. If the content is modified, then there's
	// an obvious conflict since we couldn't propagate the modification without
	// overwriting the changes on beta. Even if alpha is only subject to
	// deletion changes (i.e. it's a subtree of the ancestor), we still want to
	// maintain the mirroring property of the synchronization, and we can't
	// propagate the deletion without overwriting the contents on beta. You may
	// be asking yourself about the case of alpha and beta both being
	// directories, with alpha having deleted a subset of the tree that doesn't
	// conflict with beta's changes. Well, if both were directories, we wouldn't
	// be here, because we would have simply recursed. At this point, it's
	// guaranteed that one of alpha or beta is not a directory, in which case
	// there's no way that propagation of alpha's (non-nil) contents (modified
	// or not) won't overwrite the changes to beta.
	//
	// The requirement that at least one of ancestor or beta be a (potentially
	// nil) non-directory entry is more subtle and partially heuristically
	// motivated. If both were directories, it would indicate that alpha had
	// also previously been a directory (remember that it can't be now or we
	// would have recursed) and it would not be well-defined which portion of
	// the deletions on alpha should be propagated to the contents of beta. You
	// can't just leave beta as is because that policy would prevent entire
	// directory hierarchies from being deleted, even if only modified partially
	// at a much lower level. Trying to figure out which content on beta should
	// be deleted to "represent" the deletion changes on alpha is neither
	// well-defined nor intuitive. Additionally, at the end of the day, there's
	// no way to delineate the "source" of creation of the directories acting as
	// parents to the modified content (were they "created" on alpha or beta?
	// what if it was due to both-created-same behavior? etc.).
	//
	// Despite the relative complexity of this condition, it still covers a
	// large number of cases. For example, it covers the case that beta creates
	// contents - they are simply not propagated back to alpha. It also covers
	// the case where alpha has deleted something and beta has modified or
	// replaced it - the new beta contents are simply left in place (assuming
	// that they aren't contents at a lower level of a directory hierarchy that
	// alpha has deleted).
	//
	// Finally, since the ancestor is
	// updated with Apply, the Old value will be ignored anyway (since it
	// doesn't need to be transitioned away like on-disk contents do during
	// a transition), so we just set it to nil, rather than the old contents
	// of the ancestor.

	// At this point, there's nothing else we can handle using heuristics. We
