// Archive is a wrapper around Entry that allows identification of non-existent
// roots when serializing. In-memory, a nil-Entry (that arrives without any
// error) represents an absence of content on the filesystem. Unfortunately,
// there is no way to represent that as an encoded message (an empty byte slice
// would successfully decode to an empty directory entry). By adding a level of
// indirection that allows for an unset root entry, we can encode Entry messages
// in a way that allows us to represent absence.
