// Watcher is a intermediate interface for wrapping inotify, ReadDirChangesW,
// FSEvents, kqueue and poller implementations.
//
// The watcher implementation is expected to do its own mapping between paths and
// create watchers if underlying event notification does not support it. For
// the ease of implementation it is guaranteed that paths provided via Watch and
// Unwatch methods are absolute and clean.
type Watcher interface {
	// Watch requests a watcher creation for the given path and given event set.
	Watch(path string, event Event) error

	// Unwatch requests a watcher deletion for the given path and given event set.
	Unwatch(path string) error

	// Rewatch provides a functionality for modifying existing watch-points, like
	// expanding its event set.
	//
	// Rewatch modifies existing watch-point under for the given path. It passes
	// the existing event set currently registered for the given path, and the
	// new, requested event set.
	//
	// It is guaranteed that Tree will not pass to Rewatch zero value for any
	// of its arguments. If old == new and watcher can be upgraded to
	// recursiveWatcher interface, a watch for the corresponding path is expected
	// to be changed from recursive to the non-recursive one.
	Rewatch(path string, old, new Event) error

	// Close unwatches all paths that are registered. When Close returns, it
	// is expected it will report no more events.
